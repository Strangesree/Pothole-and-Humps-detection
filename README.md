# Pothole and Humps Detection

This project aims to detect and identify potholes and humps in images using computer vision techniques. The provided Flask application allows users to upload an image and obtain the detection results.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. The project dependencies can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Create a new environment using the command mentioned above to install the required dependencies.

2. Run the Flask application by executing the following command:

```
python app.py
```

3. Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL. The Flask application interface will be displayed.

4. Upload an image using the file upload functionality on the web page.

5. The uploaded image will be processed using the detection algorithm, and the results will be displayed.

## Additional Information

- The detection algorithm used in this project is based on state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and trained on relevant datasets.(For the dataset which this program is trained is in Main branch switch to main branch there you can download the datasets).

- The performance and accuracy of the detection algorithm may vary based on various factors such as image quality, lighting conditions, and the presence of noise.

- It's recommended to use images with clear visibility of potholes and humps for accurate detection results.
